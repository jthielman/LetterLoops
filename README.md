# Letter Loops
A little assignment for class, this prompts the user for an input and converts it to a new string where each character is repeated the same number of times as its position (not 0-indexed) in the original string.  The first instance of each character is capitalized and the rest are lower case, and the sets of each character are separated by hyphens.
